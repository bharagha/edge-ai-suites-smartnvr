# Build and Deploy Using Docker Compose

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to build and deploy the Smart NVR Sample Application using Docker Compose. You'll learn how to:
- Build the required images for the application.
- Start the application and ensure all services are running.
- Verify the deployment to confirm the application is functioning correctly.

Docker Compose simplifies the deployment process by managing multiple containers as a single application. For more details, see [Docker Compose Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

## Setup the environment variables
- Setup the following environment variables
  ```bash
     export FRIGATE_IP=<frigate-ip-address> #IP address of the Frigate VMS (required)
     export FRIGATE_PORT=<frigate-port> #Port of the Frigate VMS (required, typically 5000)
     export VSS_SUMMARY_IP=<vss-ip-address> #IP address of the Video Summarization service (required)
     export VSS_SUMMARY_PORT=<vss-port> #Port of the Video Summarization service (required, typically 12345)
     export VSS_SEARCH_IP=<vss-ip-address> #IP address of the Video Search service (required)
     export VSS_SEARCH_PORT=<vss-port> #Port of the Video Search service (required, typically 12345)
     export VLM_MODEL_IP=<vlm-model-end-point-ip-address> #IP address of the VLM Model Endpoint (required)
     export VLM_MODEL_PORT=<vlm-model-end-point-port> #Port of the VLM Model Endpoint (required, typically 9766)
     export MQTT_USER=<mqtt-user> #Add your mqtt user          
     export MQTT_PASSWORD=<pwd> #Add your mqtt password
     export HOST_IP=<host-ip>  # It's the IP address where the NVR Event Router will run
  ```

## Build the images
Clone the repository if not already done.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git
cd edge-ai-suites/metro-ai-suite/smart-nvr
```
A script is provided to ease the task of building the images as well manage the built images. Run the following command to build the image.
  ```bash
  ./build.sh
  ```
