# Get Started

<!--
**Sample Description**: Provide a brief overview of the application and its purpose.
-->
The Smart NVR sample application brings GenAI-powered vision analytics to traditional network video recorders, enabling intelligent event detection and real-time insights directly at the edge. With this guide, youâ€™ll quickly deploy, configure, and experience advanced video analytics capabilities that help you manage and extract value from your video data.

## Prerequisites
- Verify that your system meets the [Minimum Requirements](./system-requirements.md).
- Install Docker: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Enable running docker without "sudo": [Post Install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
- Install Git: [Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Start Frigate NVR by referring to this [guide]()

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Run the following command to create a local repo.
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git
     cd edge-ai-suites/metro-ai-suite/smart-nvr
     ```

2. **Setup required environment variables**:
   - Setup the following environment variables
     ```bash
     export FRIGATE_IP=<frigate-ip-address> #IP address of the Frigate VMS (required)
     export FRIGATE_PORT=<frigate-port> #Port of the Frigate VMS (required, typically 5000)
     export VSS_IP=<vss-ip-address> #IP address of the Video Search and Summarization service (required)
     export VSS_PORT=<vss-port> #Port of the Video Search and Summarization service (required, typically 12345)
     export VLM_MODEL_IP=<vlm-model-end-point-ip-address> #IP address of the VLM Model Endpoint (required)
     export VLM_MODEL_PORT=<vlm-model-end-point-port> #Port of the VLM Model Endpoint (required, typically 9766)
     export MQTT_USER=<mqtt-user> #Add your mqtt user          
     export MQTT_PASSWORD=<pwd> #Add your mqtt password
     export HOST_IP=<host-ip>  # It's the IP address where the NVR Event Router will run
     ```
   - Setup the registry details
     ```bash
     export REGISTRY="intel/"
     ```

3. **Pull images from registry**:
   

4. **Start the Application**:
   Start the application using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

5. **Verify the Application**:
   Check that the application is running:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

6. **Access the Application**:
   Open a browser and go to `http://<host-ip>:7860` to access the application.
